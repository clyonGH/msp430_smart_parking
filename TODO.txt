End-of-study project by Mathieu GERIER and CÃ©line LY

To be modified
At the moment ID_PARKING is not well implemented; the only parking id that will be sent through the serial port is the one belonging to the global hub...
> forward_state() needs to be changed
> main() needs to be changed

To be improved/added
a) A delay needs to be set for the sensor to stop sending its state (momentarily at least) if no ack is received.
b) Sensors should be repeatedly checked to make sure they are still operative.
c) LPM/WOR is not implemented.
d) CCA is not implemented.
e) Regarding the network, sensors and hubs are all allocated statically.
